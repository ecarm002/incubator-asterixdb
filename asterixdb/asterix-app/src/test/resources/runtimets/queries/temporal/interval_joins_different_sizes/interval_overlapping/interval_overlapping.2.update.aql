 * Description      :   Check temporal join functionality when spilling for interval
 * Expected Result  :   Success
 * Date             :   11th Jul, 2017
 */

/*
 * The number of active tuples must exceed join memory.
 *
 * 1024 time points * 2 arrival rate = 2048 records
 * 2048 records / 4 nodes = 512 tuples per node
 *
 * 32000 byte frame size / ~1000 byte record = 32 records per frame
 * 256000 byte join size / ~1000 byte record = 256 records join memory
 *
 * 256 duration * 2 arrival rate = 512 active records
 * 512 active records > 256 records join memory = spilling
 *
 * Also, note that 512 tuples per node plus the overlapping intervals (512 before and 
 * 512 after) ensures enough active tuples for spilling.
